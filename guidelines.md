# Guidelines

1. As a staff member, your presence within the server is essential. Attendance at meetings is mandatory unless you are on LOA or have a valid reason, which must be communicated at least 12 hours before the meeting. While you are not required to join every SSU, you must meet your quota, and any additional participation is appreciated.
2. You must request an LOA if you cannot moderate or be active on the server for more than 3 days, providing a valid reason for your absence is required.
3. You must demonstrate excellent role-playing skills to set a good example. Breaking in-game rules will result in the same punishment as for any other member. Continued violations may result in infractions.
4. All tickets, chat channels, and server sectors must be handled with discretion, professionalism, and efficiency as required. We must demonstrate our capability. Any unauthorized disclosure of restricted information to regular members will result in termination.
5. Only HR+ members are permitted to manage reports. You may not handle reports concerning yourself. If someone approaches you to report a staff member, direct them to create a management ticket within the Discord server.
6. Any form of permission abuse, whether for personal benefit or that of others, in-game or on Discord, is strictly prohibited and will result in an infraction, potentially leading to termination or blacklist.
7. Your in-game moderation permissions are strictly for moderation purposes only. Only those with the "Off Duty Command Permission" role can use commands while off duty, but not in a way that benefits them within a roleplay. Any violation of these guidelines will result in an infraction, potentially leading to termination or blacklisting.
8. You must choose to be either on duty or off duty; you cannot be both simultaneously. It is prohibited to be on duty while also role-playing.
9. Before warning a user, it is imperative to analyze the situation thoroughly and consider all possibilities. Listening to the other person's point of view is mandatory before taking any action, except in cases of clear trolling, such as Mass RDM or Staff Evasion.
10. It is necessary to give verbal warnings before issuing logged ones, but you may warn directly if the situation warrants it. You cannot kick or ban a player without first checking their moderation history or reviewing their actions. For example, staff evasion warrants an immediate kick, while RDM requires a warning; after three warnings, you may kick the player.
11. Normal rules still apply. Being a staff member does not grant you the privilege to break rules that others must follow.
12. If you have a personal or specific issue with a member of the staff team, please DM an HR directly. Do not misuse HR's time or patience.
13. Favoritism is strictly prohibited on our server. We ensure everyone is treated equally, regardless of their personal characteristics or roles. Whether VIP, staff, or a regular member, any instance of favoritism will result in infractions.
14. Unbanning someone without prior approval from an HR or SHR is strictly prohibited.
15. Every staff member is expected to meet their quota (except those on LOA). Failure to complete the quota may result in infractions.
