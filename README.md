Each role has distinct tasks, and with more roles comes greater control as well as increased responsibility. We ensure that the rules outlined in our documents and on our rule boards are followed. Our role includes identifying rule-breakers and ensuring they face appropriate consequences. Additionally, we strive to create a comfortable environment for all members of our server.
